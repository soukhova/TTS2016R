# TTS2016R

## 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) data package: trips and estimated travel time to work in the Greater Golden Horsehoe area, Canada

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/465815515.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/465815515)

This package contains objects which are sourced from the 2016
Transportation Tomorrow Survey
[(TTS)](http://dmg.utoronto.ca/drs) or are curated to
facilitate the use and analysis of TTS data. TTS 2016 is one of the
largest travel surveys in southern Ontario, Canada, and a slice of this
survey has been cleaned, packaged, and augmented for easy use in an `R`
environment.

A data paper describing and discussing this package has been published: 
Soukhov, A., & Páez, A. (2023). TTS2016R: A data set to study population and employment patterns from the 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey in the Greater Golden Horseshoe area, Ontario, Canada. Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 0(0). DOI:10.1177/23998083221146781

## What is this data package?

{TTS2016R} is an open data product. Open data products are the result of turning source data (open or otherwise) into accessible information that adds value to the original inputs [see Arribas et. al (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10109-021-00363-5). The product presented in this repo is an `R` data package that consists of objects that are sourced from the 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) or are curated to facilitate the use and analysis of TTS data. This package includes person-to-jobs origin-destinations, traffic analysis zone (TAZ) boundaries and planning/municipality boundaries for the Greater Golden Horse area (GGH) in Ontario, Canada [Data Management Group (2018)](http://dmg.utoronto.ca/transportation-tomorrow-survey/tts-introduction). In addition, the package includes TAZ centroid-to-centroid travel times by car computed using package [`r5r`](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r).

Data from the TTS are freely available to the public through the [TTS Data Retrieval System](http://dmg.utoronto.ca/drs) but the raw data can be technically demanding, cumbersome to work with, and could require multiple software to process. By pre-processing the data in a `R` environment, {TTS2016R} offers a slice of the TTS data useful to understand patterns of commuting to work in the region. It also provides open infrastructure for additional TTS or complimentary data sets to be amended by the authors or wider open-source community in the future. 

## Setup

Installation:

``` r
if (!require("remotes", character.only = TRUE)) {
      install.packages("remotes")
  }
remotes::install_github("soukhova/TTS2016R",
                        build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Data Overview

The 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) data is from the the Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH), an area that is located within the province of Ontario, Canada (43.6°N 79.73°W). Included within are the associated municipality boundaries, boundaries of the Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZ), a table with the number of full-time jobs and associated full-time workers at each TAZ, and the trips (by primary mode) from origin (residential TAZ) to destination (workplace TAZ). Also included are calculated travel times by car (calculated via [`r5r`](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r)) and derived impedance function values corresponding to the cost of travel based on the trip length distribution.

The plot that follows has a spatial visualization of the number of workers
and jobs within each TAZ:

Let's take a look at a slice of the TTS 2016 OD data. We filter the OD table to show a few OD pairs that have 2 workers at the origin and their associated estimated car travel time (minutes):

This manuscript presents the open data product
\href{https://github.com/soukhova/TTS2016R}{\{TTS2016R\}}. Open data
products are the result of turning source data (open or otherwise) into
accessible information that adds value to the original inputs
\citep[see][]{Arribas2021open}. The product presented in this paper is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a
}\DIFaddend \texttt{R} data package which currently consists of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{three objects
which are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a fusion of objects
from a variety of sources: home-to-work flows }\DIFaddend sourced from the 2016
Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS)

\DIFadd{What is a }\texttt{\DIFadd{R}} \DIFadd{data package? A }\texttt{\DIFadd{R}} \DIFadd{data package contains
code, data, and documentation in a standardised collection format that
can be installed by }\texttt{\DIFadd{R}} \DIFadd{users through a centralized software
repository such as CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) and
GitHub. \{TTS2016R\} is freely available on GitHub for all to install
and freely use in the spirit of open and reproducible research.
Currently and in more detail, \{TTS2016R\} includes full-time home-based
work-to-job origin destinations (OD) counts and mode-specific trip
numbers retrieved from the 2016 TTS}\DIFaddend , traffic analysis zone (TAZ)
boundaries, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{planning/municipality}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{municipality, planning, and census metropolitan area
}\DIFaddend boundaries for the Greater Golden Horse area (GGH) located in southern
Ontario, Canada\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{data_management_group_tts_2018}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend . In addition, the package includes TAZ
centroid-to-centroid travel times by car\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, transit, cycling, and walking
mode }\DIFaddend computed using package \{r5r\} \citep{Pereira2021r5r}.
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend The aim of this paper is to walk readers through the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{empirical home-based work commute data set,
illustrate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data sets,
illustrate a use case (i.e., }\DIFaddend the calculation of an impedance function
that can be used to calculate accessibility to employment\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend , and invite
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{its use in other
applications. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{others to experiment in its uses and applications. Though data from the
TTS is freely available to the public through the
}\href{https://dmg.utoronto.ca/idrs/index}{\DIFadd{TTS Data Retrieval System}}\DIFadd{,
the raw data can be technically demanding, cumbersome to work with, and
requires multiple software to process. By pre-processing the data,
packaging it with complimentary data, and providing explicit
documentation in a }\texttt{\DIFadd{R}} \DIFadd{environment, \{TTS2016R\} offers a slice
of the TTS data that can be immediately used by }\texttt{\DIFadd{R}} \DIFadd{users to
analysis patterns of commuting to work in the region. Anticipate this
package to grow in the future: it currently provides an open
infrastructure for additional TTS or complimentary data sets to be
amended by the authors and the open-source community in the future by
request.

that are }\DIFaddend outside of the boundaries are counted as workers within an
origin TAZ, while jobs in TAZ that are filled by workers who reside

Figure \ref{fig:tts-workers-jobs-plot} presents the number of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{workers

within this

). A travel time
threshold of 180 minutes was selected since it captures almost all

}

\DIFadd{Additionally, car travel is included in this data package because it is
a critically important commute mode in the GGH. 2,598,379 of the trips

\newpage

As can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:plot-tt-ttpertrip}, the total
travel time resembles the spatial trend distribution in the number of
employed people in the previous plot (Figure
\ref{fig:tts-workers-jobs-plot}) and the spatial distribution of the
average travel time is distinct from other plots presented so far. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For
instance, we }\DIFaddend can see that in areas around the south-eastern border \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that make up the
Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), Niagara and Waterloo, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{such
as Niagara and Waterloo (purple and brown borders), }\DIFaddend the average travel
times are moderately low. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Additionally, travel times (by car) within the
core of the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA) (blue) is also
moderately low since traffic congestion is not reflected in the travel
time calculations. }\DIFaddend Further from these areas, travel times are higher.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Interestingly, even in eastern areas (e.g.,
Peterborough) with high employment and high job concentration, average
travel time is higher than within the GTHA.

\hypertarget{calibrating-an-impedance-function}{%
\subsection{Calibrating an impedance
function}\label{calibrating-an-impedance-function}}

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{An application of the \{TTS2016R\} package is the calculation of an
impedance function. }\DIFaddend Impedance functions are useful to understand
mobility behaviour and are used to estimate gravity models of spatial
interaction \citep{wilson1971, haynes_gravity_1985} and applied in
accessibility analysis
\citep{hansen_how_1959, talen_assessing_1998, paez_jobs_2013, barboza_balancing_2021}.
An impedance function \(f(\cdot)\) depends on the cost of travel
\(c_{ij}\) between locations \(i\) and \(j\) (all which is supplied in
the travel time and origin-destination table within \{TTS2016R\}).

A useful technique to calibrate an impedance function is to use the trip
length distribution (TLD) as measured from origin-destination data
\citep{horbachov_theoretical_2018, batista_estimation_2019}. The TLD is
the representation of the likelihood that a proportion of trips are
taken at a specific travel cost. In our data set, where we assume cost
is travel time, the impedance function maps low travel times to higher
proportions of trips, and high travel times are mapped to low proportion
of trips.

Using the data contained in \{TTS2016R\}, we fit the empirical TLD to a
density distribution using maximum likelihood techniques and the
Nelder-Mead method for direct optimization available within the
\texttt{R} package \{fitdistrplus\} \citep{fitdistrplus_2015}. Based on
goodness-of-fit criteria and diagnostics seen in Figure
\ref{fig:TLD-Gamma-plot}, the gamma distribution is selected. The
`shape' parameter is \(\alpha\) = 2.019, the estimated `rate' is
\(\beta\) = 0.094 , and \(\Gamma(\alpha)\) is defined in Equation
(\ref{gamma-dist}).

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. In addition, inter-centroid

of this data package is in its transparency, easy of access, and its
open infrastructure for the addition of complimentary data sets in the
future. }\DIFaddend \texttt{R} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{environment}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{users can immediately and easily explore GGH commute

the calibration of impedance functions which in turn can be used for
accessibility analysis.

In the spirit of novel and original research, we hope readers value the
efforts made to detail the data in order to improve transparency in our
work and encourage others to replicate and, hopefully, inspire research
of their own. We see this product as providing open infrastructure for
additional TTS or complimentary data sets to be amended by the authors
or wider open-source community in the future.
